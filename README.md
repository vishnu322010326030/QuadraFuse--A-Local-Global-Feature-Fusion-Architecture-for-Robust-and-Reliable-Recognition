  QuadraFuse: Local–Global Feature Fusion for Robust Face Recognition

QuadraFuse investigates a fundamental limitation of current face recognition systems — their over-reliance on global feature representations, which leads to degraded performance under real-world variations such as occlusion, pose shifts, and illumination changes.
This project addresses the research question:
“Can a change in model training — by focusing on local features and fusing them with global features — significantly improve robustness, accuracy, and reliability compared to existing methods?”
To answer this, QuadraFuse proposes a two-branch deep learning architecture that extracts:
Global facial features preserving structural and contextual information.
Local quadrant-level features capturing fine-grained details that are less sensitive to occlusion.
The fused embedding is designed to be more discriminative, occlusion-resistant, and generalizable, enabling stronger performance across masked faces, glasses, pose variations, and lighting shifts.
This repository contains the code, model design, and experiments supporting this research.

Architecture Overview:
To review the image missing here, please refer to another README file which has been uploaded with the above files.

The QuadraFuse framework follows a dual-branch architecture that extracts both local quadrant features and global facial features.
The face is first detected and aligned, then split into four quadrants for local feature extraction.
In parallel, a global embedding is generated from the full face.
Both embeddings are fused to form a stronger, more discriminative representation.

The training and evaluation of QuadraFuse are performed using custom curated datasets and purpose-built models:
Dataset Structure
Dataset/ – Base dataset with 5 identity classes:
alexandra, courtney, elizabeth, henry, zac
➝ Used for training both traditional model and quadrafuse model.
Dataset_masked/ – Masked dataset with the same 5 identities.
➝ Used for testing and evaluating robustness under occlusion (mask scenarios).
Pretrained & Custom Models
baseline_face_recognition.pth — Standard CNN-based face recognition model (global-only).
mask_detector_resnet18.pth — Mask detection model trained to identify whether a face is masked or not.
quadrant_fusion_faces.pth — Proposed QuadraFuse model, combining local quadrant embeddings with global features for enhanced robustness.
All datasets were preprocessed (face alignment & resizing), and augmentations (lighting variation, rotation, occlusion simulation) were applied to increase generalization.

Note on Occlusion Handling:
In this phase of the project, we focused on lower-face occlusion using masks as the primary scenario to evaluate the model’s robustness.
The choice of masks was intentional — it allows us to analyze the system’s response to structured and realistic occlusion that commonly affects face recognition performance.
Additional occlusions such as spectacles and other accessories will be incorporated under the trustworthiness and robustness evaluation in the final stage of the project to further validate the model’s generalization capability.

Model Training:
QuadraFuse includes two main training approaches — a traditional global-only method and our proposed local–global fusion method.
We did 3 trainings:
1.Training traditional global only approach model which generated baseline_face_recognition.pth file
2.Training QuadraFuse model, combining local quadrant embeddings with global which generated quadrant_fusion_faces.pth file.
3.Training model to perform mask detection which generated mask_detector_resnet18.pth file.

baseline_face_recognition.pth file:
We trained a baseline face recognition model using ResNet-18 as the backbone.
The model was trained on the unmasked dataset with:
Batch size: 32
Epochs: 15
Learning rate: 1e-4 (Adam optimizer with StepLR scheduler)
Transforms: resize, horizontal flip, random rotation, color jitter, normalization
Validation split: 20%
During training, we logged train/validation accuracy and loss for each epoch.
The model with the best validation accuracy was saved as baseline_face_recognition.pth.
Finally, evaluation was done using accuracy, classification report, and a confusion matrix.
quadrant_fusion_faces.pth file:

This module implements the proposed QuadraFuse model, which enhances face recognition robustness under occlusions by fusing global and quadrant-level local features through an attention-based fusion mechanism.
Key Steps & Components:
Dataset Handling
oOrganized into class-wise folders (5 identities in this project).
oOptional INFER_FROM_FILENAME mode to auto-infer labels from filenames if no folders exist.
oUses MTCNN for face alignment and preprocessing.
oOn-the-fly augmentation (resize, flip, color jitter) for better generalization.
 Quadrant Strategy
oEach aligned face is split into 4 quadrants (TL, TR, BL, BR).
oGlobal features are extracted from the entire image.
oLocal features are extracted from each quadrant separately.
Model Pipeline
oResNet-18 backbone (pretrained on ImageNet) for both global and local embeddings.
oA lightweight attention module assigns dynamic weights to each quadrant.
oFinal fused embedding = Global + Weighted Local.
oClassification head trained using Cross-Entropy Loss.
 Training Configuration
oBatch size: 16
oEpochs: 15
oLearning rate: 1e-4 (Adam optimizer)
oValidation split: 15%
oAlignment: MTCNN face crop enabled
oDevice: GPU (if available)
 Inference Utilities
opredict_class(img_path) → predicts class and quadrant attention weights.
oface_embedding(img_path) → extracts normalized embeddings for downstream tasks.
oDynamic attention visualization makes the model interpretable.
This model forms the backbone of our work — enabling face recognition that can intelligently focus on unoccluded regions (e.g., upper face during mask scenarios) and maintain stable performance.


mask_detector_resnet18.pth file:
We trained a binary classification model using ResNet-18 to detect whether a face is masked or unmasked.
Backbone: ResNet-18 (ImageNet pretrained) with the final FC layer modified for 2 output classes.
Dataset: ImageFolder structured with two classes — masked and unmasked.
Transforms: resize, flip, rotation, color jitter, normalization.
Training:
oBatch size = 64
oEpochs = 8
oLearning rate = 3e-4 (Adam optimizer + StepLR scheduler)
o15% validation split.
Checkpointing: The best model (highest validation accuracy) is saved as mask_detector_resnet18.pth.
Evaluation: Final validation accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix are generated to measure performance.
This model is later used in the pipeline to identify occlusion (masks) and evaluate QuadraFuse robustness under masked scenarios.

Model Testing:
Testing with traditional method on occulsed face: (compare_traditional_with_masketstimages.ipynb)
In this stage, we evaluate the baseline global-only ResNet-18 face recognition model on the masked dataset (lower-face occlusion).
The goal is to measure how traditional approaches perform under real-world occlusion without any adaptive mechanisms.
Key Steps:
 Load the trained baseline_face_recognition.pth model.
 Test on the masked face dataset with five identity classes.
 Record predictions for each image:
oExtract global embeddings from the full image.
oPredict the class and compare with ground truth.
 Track progressive accuracy trend across test samples to visualize model degradation over time.
Metrics & Visualizations:
Final accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Accuracy trend curve — progressive accuracy over test samples.
Prediction correctness graph — shows correct (1) vs. incorrect (0) classification per image.
Confidence trend graph — shows model confidence and rolling average trend line.
 This experiment establishes the baseline performance of the traditional global-only model under lower-face occlusion, which is then compared against the QuadraFuse approach.

Testing with QuadraFuse method on occulsed face: 
(Test_with_mask.ipynb)

This testing pipeline evaluates the proposed local–global fusion model (QuadraFuse) on the masked face dataset, integrating a mask detector to dynamically adjust feature extraction.
Unlike the traditional model, this approach intelligently focuses on visible quadrants when masks are present.
Key Steps:
 Load mask_detector_resnet18.pth to detect mask presence in each test image.
 Load quadrant_fusion_faces.pth — the trained QuadraFuse model.
 For each image:
oDetect whether the face is masked.
oIf masked → use only the top quadrants (TL, TR), ignoring occluded lower half.
oFuse local + global embeddings to predict the identity.
 Collect predictions and compute evaluation metrics.
Metrics & Visualizations:
Final accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
Prediction correctness trend (per image).
Prediction confidence trend with rolling average smoothing.
Dynamic attention weight visualization per quadrant when masks are detected.
This mask-aware testing demonstrates how QuadraFuse maintains stable recognition accuracy even under lower-face occlusion, by leveraging local quadrant attention.

Final Results and Conclusion:

The core objective of this project was to address the accuracy drop in face recognition systems when exposed to real-world occlusions, such as masks, by enhancing the way models learn and use local + global facial features.
              Model	Accuracy on Masked Faces	 Avg.Confidence	   Observations
 Traditional (Global Only)	5.26%	71.56%	Fails under occlusion, highly confident in wrong predictions
QuadraFuse (Mask-Aware)	78.95%	75.99%	Robust against lower-face occlusion, dynamically focuses on visible regions


The traditional model performed well on unmasked faces but collapsed to 5.26 % accuracy on masked faces.
In contrast, the QuadraFuse model, equipped with a mask detector and quadrant-level fusion, achieved 78.95 % accuracy, maintaining strong confidence and stable trends throughout testing.
Confidence trends showed that traditional models remained overconfident in wrong predictions, while QuadraFuse displayed more consistent and interpretable attention behavior.
Attention visualization confirmed the model's ability to ignore occluded quadrants and rely on the upper face region.

Why This Matters:
Real-world face recognition (security, authentication, access control, etc.) often faces challenges due to partial occlusion (e.g., masks, sunglasses, scarves).
Our Quadrant-based fusion provides a lightweight and effective solution without the need for additional complex architectures.
The approach is modular — it can be combined with existing CNN/Transformer backbones to improve robustness.
    Final Verdict:
This project successfully demonstrates that occlusion-aware quadrant fusion can dramatically improve masked face recognition performance.
With nearly 15× improvement in accuracy, interpretable attention, and robust generalization, the project is a clear success and a strong proof of concept for real-world applications.
